# Ethereum Contracts

This directory contains smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network.

## Structure

- `tokens/`: Contains token-specific contracts (e.g., ERC20, ERC721 tokens)

## Adding New Contracts

New contracts are automatically added through the sync process. If you want to manually add a contract, please ensure it follows the schema defined in `schema/contract_schema.yml`.
